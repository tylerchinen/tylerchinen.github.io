Brick breaker was originally a spin off of the game pong and was developed in 1976. My group and I decided to create our own version of brick breaker with our own images to give the game a fun twist. The game uses the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to control the "paddle" or in our case the phases of the moon bar at the bottom of the screen. Then as the game begins, a plant or "a ball" will appear on the screen and begin to bounce off of the bar if it is in the correct position to block the ball from going off of the screen. Then as the ball rickochets off of the bar it can then hit the bricks at the top of the screen to be able to fulfill the ultimate goal of breaking all of the bricks.

You can view an example of the game being played on Youtube: [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEIAljnnFs).
