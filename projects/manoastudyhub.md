An issue that many students fall into in our technology driven era can be interacting with other students! The Manoa Study Hub provides a solution for this predicament. The application was created by myself and four other group members. We were able to create a place where students would be able to go to organize their own study groups which would allow them to collaborate and work with other students or tutors who are in their classes. Within our application students are able to create a profile and add study sessions as well as keep track of past, current, and future study sessions that they have or intend to attend.

Some of the features within our application include being able to login or create a new account along with a profile. Once the user is logged in they are able to view and edit their profile as well as create and edit study sessions, view the calendar with available study sessions, and view the list of study sessions page. If they should choose to attend a study session they can do this too! All with the touch of a button which will add the corresponding study session to their profile page and calendar.

The features that I contributed to this project were that I created the list study sessions page, edit study session page, and the add study session page. Within the list study session page I worked with one of my other group members to try to solve the issue of connecting the attend study session button to the other aspects of our application. I was able to use the format that we learned and worked with within our previous assignments to create a card layout for our study sessions that includes all of the information that is relevant for the user to decide if they would like to attend the study session. I also added the feature of a select search bar. This search bar includes all of the possible courses that there may by study sessions for. The user is able to select multiple courses and if there are corresponding study sessions for those courses they will be filtered out below.
