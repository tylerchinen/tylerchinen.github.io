An issue that many students fall into in our technology driven era can be interacting with other students! The Manoa Study Hub provides a solution for this predicament. The application was created by myself and four other group members. Our intent was to create a place where students would be able to go to organize their own study groups where they can collaborate and work with other students or tutors who are in their classes. Within our application students are able to create a profile and add study sessions as well as keep track of past, current, and future study sessions that they have or intend to attend.
